Ingredients (Makes 1 large pizza)
For the Dough:
2 ½ cups (315g) all-purpose flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
1 packet (7g) dry yeast
¾ cup (180ml) warm water
1 tbsp olive oil
For the Topping:
½ cup (120ml) canned San Marzano tomatoes (or any high-quality crushed tomatoes)
1 tbsp olive oil
Salt to taste
1 clove garlic (optional, for extra flavor)
200g fresh mozzarella (preferably mozzarella di bufala)
Fresh basil leaves
Extra olive oil for drizzling

Instructions
1. Make the Dough
In a small bowl, mix warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.
In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil.
Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let it rise for 1–2 hours until doubled in size.
2. Prepare the Sauce
Crush the canned tomatoes with your hands or blend them slightly for a smooth texture.
Mix in olive oil, salt, and optionally minced garlic for extra flavor.
3. Shape the Pizza
Preheat your oven to the highest setting (250°C / 480°F). If using a pizza stone, place it inside to heat up.
Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
Transfer it to a baking sheet or pizza peel if using a stone.
4. Assemble and Bake
Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough.
Tear the mozzarella into pieces and distribute evenly.
Bake for 7–10 minutes (or until the crust is golden and cheese is bubbling).
Immediately add fresh basil leaves and drizzle with olive oil.
