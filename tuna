Ingredients (Makes 1 large pizza)
For the Dough:
2 ½ cups (315g) all-purpose flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
1 packet (7g) dry yeast
¾ cup (180ml) warm water
1 tbsp olive oil
For the Topping:
½ cup (120ml) canned crushed tomatoes (San Marzano recommended)
1 tbsp olive oil
1 clove garlic, minced (optional)
Salt & black pepper to taste
200g mozzarella cheese (shredded or fresh)
1 small can (150g) tuna in oil (drained)
½ red onion, thinly sliced
½ tsp dried oregano
½ tsp red pepper flakes (optional, for spice)
Black olives (optional)
Fresh basil (optional)

Instructions
1. Make the Dough
In a small bowl, mix warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.
In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil.
Knead for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let it rise for 1–2 hours until doubled in size.
2. Prepare the Sauce
In a bowl, mix crushed tomatoes, olive oil, minced garlic (if using), salt, and pepper.
Stir well and set aside.
3. Shape the Pizza
Preheat your oven to 250°C (480°F). If using a pizza stone, place it inside to heat up.
Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your preferred thickness.
Transfer it to a baking sheet or a pizza peel if using a stone.
4. Assemble and Bake
Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough.
Add shredded or torn mozzarella evenly.
Distribute the drained tuna and sliced red onion.
Sprinkle dried oregano and red pepper flakes.
(Optional) Add black olives for extra flavor.
Bake for 7–10 minutes (or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling).
(Optional) Garnish with fresh basil and a drizzle of olive oil.
